## New in 4.0-alpha1

### Plugin support

> :wave: We're looking for feedback on this. Hit us on Gitter please!

Plugins can now be described to VersionPress using a set of plugin definitions in a `.versionpress` folder. These include:

- `actions.yml` defining plugin actions
- `schema.yml` describing how the plugin stores data in the database
- `shortcodes.yml` defining any new shortcodes the plugin introduces
- `hooks.php` containing any filters and actions further customizing the functionality 

See [docs/Plugin-Support.md](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/blob/1e994d949f8984a22f1a0733ecc493195e741181/docs/Plugin-Support.md) and please, provide any feedback you might have.
