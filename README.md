# VersionPress Documentation

Content of user documentation, eventually published to [docs.versionpress.net](http://docs.versionpress.net/en).


## Overview

VersionPress uses a docs system inspired by [Composer Docs](https://github.com/composer/composer/tree/master/doc), [Git Book](https://github.com/progit/progit) or [Azure Docs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-content/). The content is authored as a set of Markdown files in this repo and eventually published at [docs.versionpress.net](http://docs.versionpress.net/en).

Documentation is written in **Markdown**, specifically in the [MarkdownDeep dialect](http://www.toptensoftware.com/markdowndeep/) with extra mode switched on. This makes it pretty close to GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) although there might be some differences. <small>(We will switch to GFM one day.)</small>

Content is organized in **the `content` directory**:

![Content structure](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/101152/14105777/ee4fc5da-f5ad-11e5-86b1-ec73ac35419e.png)

**URLs** map to this structure pretty closely, basically just omitting the two-digit prefixes (the purpose of which is just to order things) and the file extensions. For example, `content/en/03-sync/02-cloning.md` is available at `/en/sync/cloning`.

**Section home pages** are represented by special `_index.md` files. For example, `content/en/03-sync/_index.md` is available at `/en/sync`.

**Site navigation** also reflects the file / folder structure, both in the sidebar and the "Next / Previous" links at the bottom of each topic. Documents' H1 determine the texts rendered.


## Docs versioning

We use the [Feature Toggle approach](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html) to maintain multiple versions of the documentation. There are no branches like `versionpress-1.0` or `versionpress-2.0`, all is committed into the `master` and rendered based on *version toggles*.

The system works like this:

 - Doc topics optionally specify which version they apply to using the `since:` tag. For example, the topic on WP-CLI commands is available since VersionPress 2.0 and [the file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/versionpress/docs/3ad7f2728b7134d2d7fd19b753b210d0c7b38871/content/en/02-feature-focus/10-wp-cli.md) indicates this with `since: 2.0` in its [front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).
 - The global configuration indicates which version to render, and for example if the shown version should be 1.0, the topic on WP-CLI is excluded from the navigation.

The `since:` tag can be specified either for a specific page at the top of the Markdown document or for the whole section in its `config.yml`, see e.g. [the sync section's config.yml](https://github.com/versionpress/docs/blob/9738af100e640a525c2ae0119bc3060f175b65a9/content/en/03-sync/config.yml).



## Authoring documentation

 - **Start each file with an H1 header** (`# Some Title`). This MUST be the first non-front-matter line of the document; the navigation system depends on it.
 - Use **'Title Case' for H1** headers, **'Sentence case' for H2** and below.
 - **Images**: put them in the `content/media` folder, max 700px wide, optimize them and reference relatively. Include them into Markdown like this:

```
<figure style="width: 80%;">
  <img src="../../media/image.png" alt="Alt text" />
  <figcaption>Image caption</figcaption>
</figure>
```

 - **Notes / warnings / tips** can be written in special boxes. Supported CSS classes are `note` (green), `tip` (blue), `important` (orange) and `warning` (red), the syntax is:

```
<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note title</strong></p>
  <p>This will be rendered in a highlighted box.</p>
</div>
```

 - **TODO markers** can be written as `[TODO]` or `[TODO some arbitrary text]`. They will be highlighted in yellow and should be used rarely, possibly in alpha / beta versions of the doc topic.


## Deploying docs

When a PR is merged into `master`, it is automatically deployed to [docs.versionpress.net](http://docs.versionpress.net/en).


## Localization

We currently only have an English version living in the `content/en` directory. In the future, localized versions will live in sibling directories. Contributions welcome.

## Redirects

URL redirects can be specified in `content/config.yml` like so:

```
redirects:
  'en/getting-started/old-name': 'en/getting-started/new-name'
```

Note that there is no leading slash. This leads to HTTP 301 Moved Permanently.
